A very simple cross platform client server chat application has been implemented in java. Since is easy to program in, its deal with low memory. Level memory management and includes powerful libraries for sockets and threads.

The purpose of the chat application is to allow users to be able to the chat with each other, like a normal chat application. The users will be able to chat with each other, most likely only from user to user, no group chatting will be developed, unless there is time to do so. The chat application will be written in java, but due to the lack of experience in java, while developing the application, practicing techniques with java and working on it as much as possible will help hone some java skills and be readier to develop the application.
